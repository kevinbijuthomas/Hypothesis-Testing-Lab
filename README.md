# Hypothesis-Testing-Lab

As part of this data science lab for university, I conducted hypothesis testing and statistical analysis on samples of ages from the 2011 census in England for different regions. I did Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to determine a null and alternative hypothesis, and use a z-test to check my findings.
